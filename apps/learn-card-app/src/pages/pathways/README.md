# Pathways v2

Learner-owned, agent-orchestrated graph of commitments and evidence, with every
node projectable to an Open Badges 3.0 credential.

Full architecture: [`./docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md). Companion design notes live alongside it: [`./docs/storage-and-sync.md`](./docs/storage-and-sync.md) and [`./docs/synthesis.md`](./docs/synthesis.md).

## Status (April 2026)

The architecture document's phase plan is a useful map, but we have moved well
past the Phase 0 snapshot the earlier README described. Roughly:

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **0** — Scaffolding | Route, shell, types, stores, analytics stubs | **Complete** |
| **1** — Cold start + Today | Onboard flow, Today ranking + chosenRoute, offline queue, FSRS scheduler, OBv3 projection | **Complete client-side** — VC issuance not signed end-to-end |
| **2** — Map + Build | React Flow map, node detail, Build mode (outline + inspector + policy/termination editors), composition (inline + link-out) | **Complete** |
| **3a** — Agent infrastructure | Proxy with swap-ready dispatch, 4-cap budget enforcement, cost ledger, mock agent, proposals UI, full telemetry taxonomy | **Complete with mock dispatch** |
| **3b** — First real capability (Interpretation) | Real brain-service LLM proxy behind `AgentDispatch` seam | **Not started** — no brain-service routes exist yet |
| **4** — Rest + What-If | What-If mode (simulator, generators, tradeoffs, toProposal). Matching / MCP / Routing / Nudging still mock | **What-If done, others pending** |
| **5** — FSRS reviews, social, sunset | Scheduler + review queue UI exist; endorsement fulfilment + sunset scaffolded, not wired | **Partial** |

**Beyond the original spec:** Credential Engine Registry round-trip
(`import/` + `projection/toCtdlPathway.ts`), altitude-aware arrival intent
(`Altitude` enum), and `chosenRoute` as the single source of truth shared by
Today / Map / What-If. All documented inline where they live.

**v0.5 — Action descriptors + outcome signals (April 2026):** Nodes now carry
an optional `ActionDescriptor` (`in-app-route` / `app-listing` / `external-url`
/ `mcp-tool` / `none`) that tells the UI where the learner goes to act, fully
decoupled from `Policy` and `Termination`. Pathways carry optional
`OutcomeSignal[]` — real-world results (score thresholds, enrollment,
employment) measured separately from node termination. A deterministic
credential binder (`agents/credentialBinder.ts`) proposes bindings when wallet
VCs match a signal's predicate and clear its trust tier; the learner still
confirms. See architecture doc § 3.7 / § 3.8.

## Merge readiness

Pathways v2 is **safe to merge behind the feature flag** today. The route
is conditionally mounted (`Routes.tsx:293`) and gated by both
`features.pathways` (tenant config) and the `enableJourneys` LaunchDarkly
flag — both default off (see `hooks/usePathwaysEnabled.ts`). With the
flag down, blast radius to existing wallet / credentials flows is
effectively zero.

What still needs to land **before flipping `enableJourneys` for real
users**:

1. **No Playwright E2E coverage** for the two flows the architecture spec
   requires (`docs/architecture.md` § 16): cold-start → Today
   < 10 s, and accept-proposal → next-action-changes. The unit suite is
   deep (see Testing below) but the user-visible paths have no end-to-end
   regression net.
2. **`agents/proxy.ts` is untested.** It's the swap-ready dispatch seam
   between mock and real brain-service dispatch — the day Phase 3b lands,
   untested behaviour matters. Needs unit tests for `setAgentDispatch`,
   budget gating, telemetry emission, and proposal-store integration.
3. **`offlineQueueStore.queue` is unbounded** (`stores/pathways/offlineQueueStore.ts:73`).
   Extended offline + high mutation rate is a memory hazard. Add a
   max-queue cap (drop-oldest with telemetry).
4. **Fire-and-forget signals are persisted.** `recentCompletion`,
   `recentCelebration`, and `recentRouteSwap` on `pathwayStore` will
   re-fire if the app crashes between emit and clear. Add a
   `partialize` to the persist config to exclude them.

Out of scope for this branch — but the headline items the spec is still
waiting on:

- **No brain-service routes.** The spec calls for 11 tRPC procedures
  (§ 9 in the architecture doc); `services/learn-card-network/brain-service/src/routes/pathways.ts`
  does not exist yet. Phase 3b is gated on this.
- **Mock agent dispatch** is still the default (`agents/proxy.ts`).
  Swapping to real is a single `setAgentDispatch(brainServiceDispatch)`
  call once the server half ships.

Persistence (`persist.enabled = true`) is **on** for all four stores
today (`pathwayStore`, `proposalStore`, `offlineQueueStore`,
`mcpRegistryStore`) — the previously-listed blocker around losing
state on refresh has been resolved. See
`docs/architecture.md` § 17 for the full retrospective status
column and recommended sequencing.

## Mount point

- Route: `/pathways` (redirects to `/pathways/today` when an active pathway
  exists, else `/pathways/onboard`).
- Sub-routes: `/today`, `/map`, `/what-if`, `/build`, `/proposals`,
  `/onboard`, `/node/:pathwayId/:nodeId`.
- Gating: two-layer flag — `features.pathways` (tenant config, default
  `false`) AND the `enableJourneys` LaunchDarkly flag (default `false`).
  Both must be on. Centralized in `hooks/usePathwaysEnabled.ts`; consumed
  by `Routes.tsx` (route mount) and `SideMenuSecondaryLinks.tsx` (nav
  link) so the route and the entry point can never drift.

Cross-cutting state: [`src/stores/pathways/`](../../stores/pathways/) —
`pathwayStore` (active graphs), `proposalStore` (agent proposals), `offlineQueueStore`
(queued mutations, persist **enabled**), `mcpRegistryStore` (stub).

## Design invariants (load-bearing; do not casually violate)

- **Agent proposes, learner commits.** Agents never call `pathwayStore.upsertPathway`
  or `editNode` directly. The only path from agent output to structural state is
  `agents/proxy.ts` → `proposalStore.addProposal` → learner tap → `applyProposal`.
- **Four surfaces, one data source.** Today / Map / What-If / Build all read
  the same `pathwayStore` and agree on "what's next" via `chosenRoute` +
  `selectNextAction`. Switching modes is a `history.push`, never a data fetch.
- **Projection, not mutation.** A node never stores a VC; it stores an
  `AchievementProjection`. A pathway never stores its CTDL form. Crypto +
  serialization happen at the moment of issuance / export.
- **Composition = nesting.** `policy.kind === 'composite'` + a
  `pathway-completed` termination + a `renderStyle` flag covers both
  "substeps inside this node" and "complete Pathway X first". One primitive.
- **Degradation without agents.** Today / Map / Build / What-If must render
  with `agentSignals: null`. Nothing blocks on an LLM call.

## Testing

```bash
# All pathways Vitest suites (949 tests across 55 files as of this writing,
# 4 intentionally skipped — live network contract tests gated on LIVE=true)
pnpm exec vitest run src/pages/pathways

# A single suite
pnpm exec vitest run src/pages/pathways/core/chosenRoute.test.ts
```

Playwright E2E coverage is **not yet written** — two flows are required by the
architecture doc § 16 before v1 merges. See "What's blocking production" above.

## What Pathways is not

Pathways is not a course platform. It does not serve content; it organizes
commitment. When pressure arrives to add a video player node or a lesson
builder, the answer is: Pathways points _at_ content (via MCP tools, external
credentials, curated references) but does not _host_ it.
