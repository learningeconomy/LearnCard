The LearnCard Core is a pluggable, open-source, universal digital wallet to enable any individual or organization to seamlessly **issue, earn, store, share, and spend currency and credentials** built for the future of education and work.

## Documentation
All LearnCard documentation can be found at:
https://docs.learncard.com

## Install

```bash
pnpm i @learncard/core
```

## Usage

### Instantiation

Instantiate a wallet using `initLearnCard`. This method accepts a unique identifier string that is 
up to 64 characters long. If it is less than 64 characters, `initLearnCard` will pad the start of
the string with 0's until it is 64 characters long.

```js
import { initLearnCard } from "@learncard/core";

const wallet = await initLearnCard({ seed: 'a'.repeat(64) });
```

### Issuing/Verifying Credentials and Presentations

#### Issue a credential
```js
// Grab a test VC, or create your own!
const unsignedVc = await wallet.invoke.getTestVc();

const vc = await wallet.invoke.issueCredential(unsignedVc);
```

#### Verify a credential
```js
const result = await wallet.invoke.verifyCredential(vc, {}, true);

if (result.warnings.length > 0) console.error('Verification warnings:', result.warnings);

if (result.errors.length > 0) console.error('This credential is not valid!', result.errors);
else console.log('This credential is valid!');
```

#### Issue a presentation
```js
const vp = await wallet.invoke.issuePresentation(vc);
```

#### Verify a presentation
```js
const result = await wallet.invoke.verifyPresentation(vp);

if (result.warnings.length > 0) console.error('Verification warnings:', result.warnings);

if (result.errors.length > 0) console.error('This presentation is not valid!', result.errors);
else console.log('This presentation is valid!');
```

### Storing/Retrieving/Publishing Credentials with LearnCloud
Credentials can be converted back and forth to URIs, which can be stored per holder using Control Planes. URIs simplify complex processes, such as indexing and caching, over credentials stored in many different locations, such as in IPFS, device storage, or a Decentralized Web Node.

#### Publish Credential 

After signing a VC, you may choose to publish that credential to Ceramic. Doing so will return a
stream ID, which you may share to the recipient. That stream ID can then be used to resolve the 
issued credential. This means both the issuer and recipient may store the _stream ID_ instead of the
credential itself.

```js

// Issuer

const holderDid = 'did:key:z6MknqnHBn4Rx64gH4Dy1qjmaHjxFjaNG1WioKvQuXKhEKL5'
const uvc = learnCard.invoke.newCredential({ subject: holderDid });
const vc = await learnCard.invoke.issueCredential(uvc);
const uri = await learnCard.store.LearnCloud.upload(vc);

// Holder

const credential = await learnCard.read.get(uri);
const result = await learnCard.invoke.verifyCredential(credential);

if (result.errors.length == 0) {
    await learnCard.index.LearnCloud.add({ uri, id: 'test' });
}

```

#### Reading From LearnCloud


```js

const records = await learnCard.index.LearnCloud.get();
const record = records.find(({ id }) => id === 'test');
const storedCredential = await learnCard.read.get(record.uri);

```

#### Adding a Credential to a Wallet

After receiving a streamID, you can _persist_ that streamID by calling `addCredential`, and giving
the credential a bespoke title

```js
await wallet.index.LearnCloud.add({ uri, id: 'Test VC' });
```

This will add the streamId, which can be used to resolve the verifiable credential to IDX using the
wallet's secret key. You can think of this as acting like the wallet's personal storage.

#### Getting a credential from the Wallet

After calling `addCredential`, you can use the bespoke title to retrieve that credential at any time

```js
const record = (await wallet.index.LearnCloud.get()).find(record => record.id === 'Test VC');
const vcFromIdx = await wallet.read.get(record.uri);
```

Alternatively, you can get an array of _all_ credentials you have added using `getCredentials`

```js
const uris = (await wallet.index.LearnCloud.get()).map(record => record.uri);
const vcs = await Promise.all(uris.map(async uri => wallet.read.get(uri)));
```
