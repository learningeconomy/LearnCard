This plugin for LearnCard enables the creation of "Claimable Boosts," which are credentials that users can claim via a unique link or QR code. It allows external partners or systems to easily generate and distribute credentials (boosts) without needing direct interaction with the end-user's wallet initially.

The LearnCard Core is a pluggable, open-source, universal digital wallet to enable any individual or organization to seamlessly **issue, earn, store, share, and spend currency and credentials** built for the future of education and work.
