# Introduction

####  ðŸŽ‰ First off, thank you for considering contributing to LearnCard - It's rockstars like you that make LearnCard such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

LearnCard is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into LearnCard itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Check whether the #support channel on Discord can help with your issue. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
 * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
 * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
 * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Community Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution
 Unsure where to begin contributing to LearnCard? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
* **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** Check out these resources: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

# Getting started
### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
	* Be sure all existing and new tests are passing for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the Learning Economy Foundation.
    * Note the Learning Economy Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to â€˜metadataâ€™ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Security Vulnerabilities
If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@learningeconomy.io
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
 * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
 * Can I disable something for other people?
 
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@learningeconomy.io.

### Non-Security Bugs

 When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
 1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
 2. What did you do?
 3. What did you expect to see?
 4. What did you see instead?

 General questions should go to the #general channel on Discord can help with your issue.

# Feature Suggestions & Enhancements

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in LearnCard, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that LearnCard has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
