# Use Cases & Possibilities

LearnCard helps you build apps where learners, workers, and systems can issue, store, share, and verify data they own and control.

Below are the most common use cases. These are real things being built today with LearnCard—feel free to borrow, remix, or extend.

***

### 🎓 Education & Credentialing

**Issue and manage credentials**:

* Issue diplomas, badges, transcripts, and skill certificates as W3C Verifiable Credentials
* Use Boosts for richer metadata and credential display
* Attach PDFs or supporting documents and evidence to any credential

**Verify learner achievements**:

* Accept credential submissions from any LearnCard-compatible wallet
* Validate credential integrity with zero infrastructure
* Build dashboards or reports using trusted, portable data

***

### 🧠 Learning Bots & AI Copilots

**Personalize educational experiences**:

* Translate LER data into embeddings to track semantic context and learner history
* Adapt learning content and feedback in real-time based on a learner's full portfolio
* Enable bots to "remember" user milestones and feedback across sessions

**Build secure bots**:

* Ask for granular, auditable consent with ConsentFlow
* Protect learner data using ZKPs and selective disclosure

**Agent-to-Agent credentials:**

* Create portable credentials for your AI agents to prove their skills and experiences
* Build trust for your agents with a wallet of certifications they can access and use &#x20;

### 🕹️ Games & Learning Apps

**Gamify credentials**:

* Issue Boosts and badges when players complete challenges
* Store achievements in a secure LearnCard wallet
* Let players claim credentials via QR or in-game triggers

**Integrate GameFlow**:

* Connect educational games directly to LearnCard
* Sync player progress with wallet credentials
* Add guardianship and consent for younger learners

***

### 🧾 Job Market & Workforce

**Build skill-based portfolios**:

* Allow users to store credentials from bootcamps, apprenticeships, employers
* Translate credentials into job-relevant summaries or skill graphs
* Share verifiable presentations with employers or HR tools

**Streamline hiring pipelines**:

* Accept trusted, tamper-proof credentials at application
* Automate pre-verification using LearnCard APIs

* Assign guardianship rights over a child’s LearnCard wallet
* Control what data can be shared, when, and with whom
* Get alerts and logs for all data usage

**Build dashboards for families**:

* Show learning progress across apps and institutions
* Visualize credentials earned over time

***

### 🏢 Institutions & Organizations

**Run credentialing programs**:

* Create issuing workflows with custom rules via Signing Authorities
* Use LearnCard Network for easy peer-to-peer credential exchange
* Host a custom credential viewer or verification portal

**Enable internal verification**:

* Issue internal training credentials
* Use presentations for access control or role validation

***

### 🤝 Ecosystem Interoperability

**Bridge systems**:

* Translate and sync data using standards like OBv3, CLR, LTI, and LIF
* Build adapters that pull and push data from LearnCard into LMSs, CRMs, or SISs

**Use DID Authentication**:

* Enable passwordless, portable login to your application

### 🛠️ Build Your Own Flow

The LearnCard SDK and APIs are modular—combine any of the following:

* Wallets and identity (DIDs)
* Credential issuing and verification
* Consent and access control
* Secure storage (LearnCloud)
* Peer-to-peer sharing (via QR, links, or APIs)
* AI integrations (memory + prompts + embeddings)
