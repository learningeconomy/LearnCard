# What is LearnCard?

[**LearnCard**](https://www.learncard.com) is a modular, open-source wallet and SDK designed to give learners and workers control over their credentials, achievements, and learning data. Built on open standards like [W3C Verifiable Credentials](core-concepts/credentials-and-data/verifiable-credentials-vcs.md) and [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](core-concepts/identities-and-keys/decentralized-identifiers-dids.md), LearnCard enables privacy-respecting, consent-based data sharing across educational and employment ecosystems.

Whether you're building edtech apps, issuing credentials, or designing learner-focused dashboards, LearnCard offers the foundation and flexibility to integrate trustworthy, portable data.

### How to Implement LearnCard

1. **Pick your flow**: Issue credentials, verify them, or manage a user's wallet.
2. **Install the SDK**: 
   ```bash
   npm install @learncard/init
   ```
3. **Use open standards**: LearnCard supports [Open Badges 3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/), W3C Verifiable Credentials, and more.
