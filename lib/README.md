# External Libraries

This directory is for any external libraries used by `LearnCard`. It is very likely that each of these
are a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), so if you they appear as
empty directories, you will need to run the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
