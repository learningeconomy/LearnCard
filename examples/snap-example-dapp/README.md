# MetaMask Snap Example Dapp

The LearnCard MetaMask Snap allows MetaMask users to view, issue, verify, present, and persist DIDs and Verifiable Credentials
via the LearnCard SDK. It allows dapps to use these methods without gaining access to the user's sensitive key material.
This is an example dapp built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) that demonstrates how to use the snap!
