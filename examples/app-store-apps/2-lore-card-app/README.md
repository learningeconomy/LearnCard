## Usage

### For Game Masters

1. **Open the app** - Navigate to your LoreCard deployment URL
2. **Authenticate** - The app will request your LearnCard identity (SSO)
3. **Select a badge** - Click on any badge card to award it
4. **Add recipients** (optional) - Enter player DIDs or leave empty to select in LearnCard
5. **Confirm issuance** - Complete the flow in the LearnCard modal
6. **Done!** - Players receive the badge in their LearnCard wallet

- ‚úÖ Are permanently stored in their LearnCard wallet
- ‚úÖ Can be shared with others to demonstrate skills
- ‚úÖ Are cryptographically verifiable and tamper-proof
- ‚úÖ Belong to them forever, regardless of platform

## SDK Integration

This app demonstrates the `initiateTemplateIssue()` method from `@learncard/partner-connect`:

```typescript
import { createPartnerConnect } from '@learncard/partner-connect';

// Initialize SDK
const learnCard = createPartnerConnect({
  hostOrigin: 'https://learncard.app'
});

// Award a badge
async function awardBadge(templateId, recipients) {
  try {
    const response = await learnCard.initiateTemplateIssue(
      templateId,
      recipients  // Array of DIDs (optional)
    );
    
    if (response.issued) {
      console.log('Badge awarded successfully!');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Award failed:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

The app handles common errors gracefully:

- **`UNAUTHORIZED`** - User is not an admin of the badge template
- **`TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND`** - Badge template URI is invalid or doesn't exist
- **`LC_UNAUTHENTICATED`** - User needs to log in to LearnCard
- **User cancellation** - User closed the modal without completing issuance

## Creating Badge Templates

To use LoreCard with your own badges:

1. **Log in to LearnCard Network** at [network.learncard.com](https://network.learncard.com)
2. **Create a Boost** for each badge type:
   - Go to Boosts ‚Üí Create New Boost
   - Design your badge (name, description, image)
   - Set yourself as an admin
3. **Get the Boost URI** - Copy the `lc:network:...` URI from the boost page
4. **Update `.env`** - Add the URIs to your environment configuration
5. **Deploy** - Redeploy your LoreCard instance with new configuration

## Customization

### Add New Badges

1. **Add environment variable** in `.env.example` and `.env`:
   ```bash
   BADGE_YOUR_SKILL_URI=lc:network:network.learncard.com/trpc:boost:your-id
   ```

2. **Update config** in `src/pages/index.astro`:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
     badges: {
       yourSkill: import.meta.env.BADGE_YOUR_SKILL_URI || 'default-uri',
       // ... other badges
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Add badge card** in the HTML:
   ```html
   <div class="badge-card your-skill" data-badge="yourSkill">
     <div class="badge-icon">üåü</div>
     <div class="badge-name">Your Badge Name</div>
     <div class="badge-description">Description of when to award this badge.</div>
     <div class="badge-skill">Social-Emotional Skill: Your Skill</div>
   </div>
   ```

4. **Add color** in the CSS:
   ```css
   .badge-card.your-skill { --badge-color: #yourcolor; }
   ```

5. **Update badge names** in the script:
   ```javascript
   const badgeNames = {
     yourSkill: 'Your Badge Name',
     // ... other badges
   };
   ```

### Theming

The app uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --parchment: #f4e8d0;       /* Main background */
  --ink: #2c1810;              /* Text color */
  --gold: #d4af37;             /* Accent color */
  --deep-red: #8b1a1a;         /* Headings */
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

## Deployment

```toml
